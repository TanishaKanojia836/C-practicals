# C-practicals
# 1. Write a program to compute the sum of the first n terms of the following series:
S = 1 - 1 / (2 ^ 2) + 1 / (3 ^ 3) - ... 1 / (n ^ n)
where ^ is exponentiation.
The number of terms n is to be taken from user through command line. If command line argument is not found then prompt the user to enter the value of n.
